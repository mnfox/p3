Description

This is a collection of three useful tools for web developers. The XKCD Password Generator will generate easy to remember, but hard to guess passwords (as per the comic which can be seen on the page). The Lorem Ipsum Generator will generate latin filler text that can be used on your website. And finally, the User Generator will give you dummy user data that can be used for web development.

To build this I used the Skel framework (to ensure responsiveness, a grid design, and to save time when it comes to making things look pretty), FontAwesome (for icons, seen at the bottom for social media), and JQuery. I also used the Laravel framework, and utilised two excellent packages: one to aid in generating lorem ipsum, and the other to generate random users (both linked below).

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
